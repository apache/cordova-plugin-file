# org.apache.cordova.file

This plugin provides the [HTML5 Filesystem API](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/). For usage, refer
to HTML5 Rocks' [FileSystem article](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/)
on the subject. For an overview of other storage options, refer to Cordova's
[storage guide](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/edge/cordova_storage_storage.md.html).

## Installation

    cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.file

## Supported Platforms

- Amazon Fire OS
- Android
- BlackBerry 10*
- iOS
- Windows Phone 7 and 8*
- Windows 8*

\* _These platforms do not support `FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer` nor `FileWriter.write(blob)`._

## Android Quirks

### Android Persistent storage location

There are multiple valid locations to store persistent files on an Android
device. See [this page](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html)
for an extensive discussion of the various possibilities.

Previous versions of the plugin would choose the location of the temporary and
persistent files on startup, based on whether the device claimed that the SD
Card (or equivalent storage partition) was mounted. If the SD Card was mounted,
or if a large internal storage partition was available (such as on Nexus
devices,) then the persistent files would be stored in the root of that space.
This meant that all Cordova apps could see all of the files available on the
card.

If the SD card was not available, then previous versions would store data under
/data/data/<packageId>, which isolates apps from each other, but may still
cause data to be shared between users.

It is now possible to choose whether to store files in the internal file
storage location, or using the previous logic, with a preference in your
application's config.xml file. To do this, add one of these two lines to
config.xml:

    <preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Internal" />

    <preference name="AndroidPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />

Without this line, the File plugin will use "Compatibility" as the default. If
a preference tag is present, and is not one of these values, the application
will not start.

If your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older (pre-
1.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the persistent filesystem,
then you should set the preference to "Compatibility". Switching the location to
"Internal" would mean that existing users who upgrade their application may be
unable to access their previously-stored files, depending on their device.

If your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then the "internal" setting is generally recommended.

## BlackBerry Quirks

`DirectoryEntry.removeRecursively()` may fail with a `ControlledAccessException` in the following cases:

- An app attempts to access a directory created by a previous installation of the app.

> Solution: ensure temporary directories are cleaned manually, or by the application prior to reinstallation.

- If the device is connected by USB.

> Solution: disconnect the USB cable from the device and run again.

## iOS Quirks
- `FileReader.readAsText(blob, encoding)`
  - The `encoding` parameter is not supported, and UTF-8 encoding is always in effect.

### iOS Persistent storage location

There are two valid locations to store persistent files on an iOS device: the
Documents directory and the Library directory. Previous versions of thie plugin
only ever stored persistent files in the Documents directory. This had the
side-effect of making all of an application's files visible in iTunes, which
was often unintended, especially for applications which handle lots of small
files, rather than producing complete documents for export, which is the
intended purpose of the directory.

It is now possible to choose whether to store files in the documents or library
directory, with a preference in your application's config.xml file. To do this,
add one of these two lines to config.xml:

    <preference name="iosPersistentFileLocation" value="Library" />

    <preference name="iosPersistentFileLocation" value="Compatibility" />

Without this line, the File plugin will use "Compatibility" as the default. If
a preference tag is present, and is not one of these values, the application
will not start.

If your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older (pre-
1.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the persistent filesystem,
then you should set the preference to "Compatibility". Switching the location to
"Library" would mean that existing users who upgrade their application would be
unable to access their previously-stored files.

If your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the
persistent filesystem, then the "Library" setting is generally recommended.
